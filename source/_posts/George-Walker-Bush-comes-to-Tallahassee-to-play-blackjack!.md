#  George Walker Bush comes to Tallahassee to play blackjack!

George Walker Bush came to Tallahassee to play blackjack on November 6, 2014. The former President of the United States was in town to receive an award from the Economic Club of Florida.

Bush arrived at the Governor's Mansion just before 10 p.m. and went straight to the blackjack table, where he played for about two hours. He reportedly lost more than $2,000 on the night.

"He's a pretty good player," said Jimmy Patronis, who was playing next to Bush at the table. "He was very cool, calm and collected."

Patronis said that no one recognized Bush until he started placing his bets.

"I don't think many people knew it was him until he started playing," Patronis said. "He blended right in."

Bush has a well-known history with blackjack. In 2002, he famously won $15,000 while playing the card game at an Atlantic City casino.

Former President George Walker Bush was spotted playing blackjack in Tallahassee, Florida this past weekend! The 43rd President of the United States was seen at the Black Diamond Casino, and even posed for a few pictures with fans!

Bush was in town to campaign for his brother, Jeb Bush, who is running for Governor of Florida. It's not clear if he was gambling with his own money or if he was using chips from the casino.

This isn't the first time that George Bush has been spotted at a casino. In fact, he's something of a regular at casinos all over the country. In 2011, he was caught playing blackjack at the Wynn Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

Casino gambling is a controversial topic, with some people saying that it's harmless fun and others arguing that it can be addictive and dangerous. What do you think?

#  President George Walker Bush visits Tallahassee to play blackjack!

In what could be a scene out of the movie "Casino", President George Walker Bush made an unannounced visit to Tallahassee, Florida on Saturday to play blackjack at a local casino. The president, who was in town for a fundraiser, evidently became bored after the event and asked his Secret Service agents to take him to the casino.

According to witnesses, Bush anxiously played blackjack at the casino for several hours before returning to his hotel. Local law enforcement officials say they had no prior knowledge of the president's visit and were not prepared to provide security. One agent reportedly said, "We didn't have time to put on our bullet-proof vests."

Bush's spokeswoman declined to comment on the president's visit, but one unnamed White House official said, "The president likes to play blackjack and he enjoys mixing with the people."

The trip is sure to generate controversy, as it comes just days before the presidential election. Some Democrats are already charging that Bush is using taxpayer dollars for a campaign stunt. However, Republicans insist that Bush is simply doing what any good American would do - enjoying a day off playing slots and blackjack in sunny Florida.
