#  How Updike's Baccarat Midi Changed the Game Forever

In the late 1970s, Baccarat was the game of choice for high rollers in Las Vegas. The stakes were high, and so were the rewards. That all changed when John Updike published a short story about a group of people who meet up at a casino in Atlantic City to play Baccarat.

Updike's story, "Baccarat Midi," introduced a new way to play the game that simplified the process and made it more accessible to average players. His version of Baccarat became known as Midi Baccarat, and it quickly spread to casinos all over the world.

Today, Midi Baccarat is the most common version of the game. It's played with six decks of cards, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. There are no specific rules about which cards can be used to make a point, so players have more flexibility in their betting options.

Midi Baccarat has become one of the most popular games in casinos because it's simple to learn and offers plenty of excitement and potential rewards. If you're looking for a fun and challenging casino game, give Midi Baccarat a try!

#  The Legacy of John Updike and His Iconic Baccarat Midi

John Updike, one of the most renowned American writers of the 20th century, left an enduring legacy in both his personal and professional life. After a prolific career as a writer, he was honored with a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for his last novel, "The End of the Affair."

Updike was also well-known for his love of luxury and high-end brands. He counted among his close friends fashion designer Bill Blass and Baccarat CEO Stanislas Destezet. It was no surprise then that when Updike decided to commission a new home in the late 1980s, he chose to work with Destezet on a unique property that would become known as the Baccarat Midi.

The Midi was designed as an opulent ode to Updike's favorite pastime - playing baccarat at casinos around the world. The home features 12 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, two kitchens, three bars, and a casino complete with gaming tables and slot machines. Updike spared no expense in outfitting the Midi with the very best of everything, from top-of-the-line appliances to rare marble flooring from Italy.

Even after Updike's death in 2009, the Midi remains one of the most iconic homes in America. Celebrities and wealthy homeowners constantly tour the property in hopes of catching a glimpse of its over-the-top luxury. In fact, it has even been used as a set for several Hollywood movies and television shows.

What makes the Midi so special is not just its luxurious amenities, but also its connection to John Updike himself. It was his personal refuge from the outside world where he could escape into his own private casino and enjoy some downtime with friends. For anyone who appreciates luxury and fine craftsmanship, the Baccarat Midi is truly a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.
