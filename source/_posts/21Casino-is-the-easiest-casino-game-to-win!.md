#  21Casino is the easiest casino game to win!

Did you know that 21Casino is one of the easiest casino games to win? Not only is it easy to play, but with a bit of practice you could be raking in the wins too!

In this article we take a look at how to play 21Casino, as well as some tips and tricks to help you win. So read on and learn everything you need to know about this thrilling casino game.

How to Play 21Casino

21Casino is a simple game to play. You just need to choose black or red and then bet on your choice. If the card shown is the colour you guessed, you will win even money on your bet. However, if the card shown is not the colour you guessed, then you will lose your bet.

The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. If your first two cards add up to 21, you have ‘blackjack’ and will win automatically!

There are a few important things to remember when playing 21Casino:

-You can only split pairs once (ie two eights can be split but two fives cannot)

-You can hit as many times as you like, but be careful not to bust (go over 21)

-If the dealer has blackjack, they will automatically win, no matter what your hand is like


Building Your Strategy for Winning at 21 Casino

 There are a few things that you can do in order to improve your chances of winning when playing 21 Casino:   -Be selective about when you hit – if the dealer has low cards (2-6), it might be worth standing rather than hitting and risking going bust.   -Remember that if you tie with the dealer, you neither win nor lose – so make sure that before you go over 21, there’s a good chance that the dealer is going bust too!   -Always split Aces and Eights – these are two of the strongest hands in the game.   - remembering all of these tips should help give you an edge when playing 21 Casino!
