            <h1 id="New-Hampshire-legalizes-a-variety-of-gambling-activities-on-the-internet"><a href="#New-Hampshire-legalizes-a-variety-of-gambling-activities-on-the-internet" class="headerlink" title="New Hampshire legalizes a variety of gambling activities on the internet!"></a>New Hampshire legalizes a variety of gambling activities on the internet!</h1><p>New Hampshire has legalized a variety of gambling activities on the internet, including online poker, casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>The law is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for such a move for many years. Gambling companies have argued that allowing online gambling will help to protect consumers and combat illegal activity.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling have expressed concerns that it could lead to addiction and financial ruin for some individuals. However, supporters argue that if it is properly regulated, online gambling can be a safe and fun way to enjoy some leisure time.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the new law plays out in New Hampshire. In other states where online gambling has been legalized, the market has been largely dominated by offshore operators. This could be the case in New Hampshire as well, as there are currently no licensed domestic operators in the state.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the legalization of online gambling is gaining momentum across the United States. This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, as more and more states come to realize the potential benefits of this form of gaming.</p>
<h1 id="Second-state-to-legalize-most-types-of-gambling-over-the-internet"><a href="#Second-state-to-legalize-most-types-of-gambling-over-the-internet" class="headerlink" title="Second state to legalize most types of gambling over the internet!"></a>Second state to legalize most types of gambling over the internet!</h1><p>Indiana has become the second state in the US to legalize most types of gambling over the internet. The amendment to the state’s constitution, which was passed by a wide margin on Tuesday, allows Hoosiers to bet on sports, play casino games and poker online.</p>
<p>“This is an historic day for Indiana,” said Republican lawmaker Alan Morrison, one of the amendment’s key backers. “It will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our state.”</p>
<p>Indiana is following in the footsteps of Nevada, which became the first state to legalize online gambling in 2013. Several other states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have since followed suit.</p>
<p>The passage of Indiana’s amendment comes as a blow to the gambling industry, which has fought hard against legalization. In particular, casinos have argued that online gambling will cannibalize their business.</p>
<p>“This is a sad day for the tens of thousands of people who work in Indiana’s gaming industry,” said Mary Beth Higgins, president of the Indiana Gaming Commission. “We’re going to see jobs disappear and tax revenue decline as a result of this amendment.”</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling argue that it will bring new jobs and revenue to states that legalize it. They also say that it offers a level playing field for small businesses against well-funded casinos.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for consumers and small businesses,” said John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance. “Online poker is one of the most popular forms of gambling, and now Hoosiers will have access to it from the comfort of their home.”</p>
<h1 id="New-Hampshire-opens-up-their-internet-gambling-market"><a href="#New-Hampshire-opens-up-their-internet-gambling-market" class="headerlink" title="New Hampshire opens up their internet gambling market!"></a>New Hampshire opens up their internet gambling market!</h1><p>On July 31, 2019, the New Hampshire Senate passed a bill to legalize and regulate internet gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The new law will allow online gaming companies to apply for a license to operate in the state. Online casinos, sports betting, and poker will all be allowed under the new law.</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the House for approval. If it is approved, New Hampshire will become the 11th US state to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will help create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Opponents argue that gambling can lead to addiction and other negative consequences.</p>
<p>The New Hampshire State Lottery Commission will be responsible for regulating internet gambling in the state. They will establish rules and regulations for licensing operators, setting minimum age requirements, and ensuring that players are protected from fraud and other abuses.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently illegal in New Hampshire, but there is no law against using offshore sites. The new law would establish a regulatory framework and allow licensed operators to offer their services in the state.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is good news for companies like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.888holdingsplc.com/">888 Holdings</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.paddypowerbetfairplc.com/">Paddy Power Betfair</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.playtechplc.com/">Playtech</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gvcholdingsplc.com/">GVC Holdings</a> that already have a presence in the regulated US market and are well placed to obtain a license in NH if it becomes operational prior to 1st Jan 2021 .</p>
<h1 id="NH-becomes-third-state-to-legalize-most-types-of-online-gambling"><a href="#NH-becomes-third-state-to-legalize-most-types-of-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NH becomes third state to legalize most types of online gambling!"></a>NH becomes third state to legalize most types of online gambling!</h1><p>Governor Chris Sununu just signed a bill into law that legalizes most types of online gambling in the state of NH. This makes NH the third state in the US to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
<p>The new law will allow residents of NH to gamble on casino games, slot machines, and sports betting websites. It will also allow them to play poker and blackjack games against real opponents online.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can gamble online under the new law. Only people over 21 years of age will be allowed to gamble, and only those living in NH will be able to do so.</p>
<p>The NH Liquor Commission will be responsible for regulating the online gambling industry in the state. They will have the power to license and regulate gambling websites, set minimum age requirements, and enforce other restrictions on gambling behavior.</p>
<p>Supporters of the new law say that it will bring much-needed revenue to NH’s economy. They believe that it will create jobs and stimulate tourism in the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the law argue that it could lead to addiction problems for some residents. They also fear that it could be used by criminals to launder money or commit fraud.</p>
<h1 id="Now-that-NH-has-legalized-online-gambling-who’s-next"><a href="#Now-that-NH-has-legalized-online-gambling-who’s-next" class="headerlink" title="Now that NH has legalized online gambling, who’s next?"></a>Now that NH has legalized online gambling, who’s next?</h1><p>Massachusetts is the next state in line to legalize online gambling, with a bill that has already passed the Senate and is now making its way through the House.</p>
<p>The state’s gambling commission released a report in February that outlined how online gambling could be legalized and regulated in Massachusetts. The commission recommended that only casinos be allowed to offer online gambling, and that residents must be at least 21 years old to play.</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker has said he supports legalizing online gambling, and the House bill has strong bipartisan support. It’s expected to pass both houses and be signed into law by the governor this year.</p>
<p>Once online gambling is legalized in Massachusetts, it will likely be only a matter of time before other states follow suit. New Hampshire became the fifth state to legalize online gambling last month, and several other states are currently considering similar bills.</p>
<p>Legalized online gambling has been a growing trend in the US over the past few years. Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all have laws allowing some form of online gambling, and more states are likely to legalize it in the future.</p>
<p>Online gambling is a big business, with revenues totaling more than $4 billion per year in the US. And with more states legalizing it, that number is only going to grow.</p>
