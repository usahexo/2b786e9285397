            <h1 id="Florida-lawmakers-to-discuss-legalizing-sports-betting-in-coming-weeks"><a href="#Florida-lawmakers-to-discuss-legalizing-sports-betting-in-coming-weeks" class="headerlink" title="Florida lawmakers to discuss legalizing sports betting in coming weeks"></a>Florida lawmakers to discuss legalizing sports betting in coming weeks</h1><p>Florida lawmakers will discuss legalizing sports betting in the coming weeks, state Rep. Jose Felix Diaz said Thursday.</p>
<p>Diaz, a Miami Republican and chairman of the House Regulatory Affairs Committee, told The Associated Press that he is working on a bill that would allow betting on professional and collegiate sports, subject to regulations set by the Florida Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>“We are going to have hearings and we are going to move forward with it,” Diaz said.</p>
<p>He did not provide a timeline for when the bill might be introduced but said it was important to get it right.</p>
<p>The announcement comes days after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law banning gambling on individual sporting events in most states. The decision clears the way for states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Rick Scott has not taken a position on whether Florida should legalize sports betting, but he has said he would be willing to listen to proposals.</p>
<p>Diaz said his bill would create an “intelligent gaming commission” that would regulate and tax sports betting in Florida. He said part of the revenue from sports betting would go toward paying for college scholarships for children of military veterans who were killed or disabled while serving their country.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-one-step-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Florida-one-step-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Florida one step closer to legalizing sports betting"></a>Florida one step closer to legalizing sports betting</h1><p>Florida lawmakers are moving closer to legalizing sports betting in the state, although a final vote has not been taken yet. The proposal would allow each of Florida’s 67 counties to decide whether or not to allow betting on sports within its borders.</p>
<p>Sponsored by state Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, the proposal passed through two committees last week and has the support of both chambers of the legislature.</p>
<p>“This is a historic day for Florida as we take another step closer to legalizing sports betting,” Diaz said in a statement. “Allowing each county to decide if they want to participate in sports betting will ensure that our local communities reap the rewards while also protecting consumers.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social ills, but supporters say it would generate new revenue for the state that could be used to fund education and other important programs.</p>
<p>If the proposal becomes law, Florida would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports betting in recent years. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling last year that struck down a federal ban on sports betting, opening the door for states to legalize it on their own terms.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-legislators-make-progress-on-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Florida-legislators-make-progress-on-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Florida legislators make progress on legalizing sports betting"></a>Florida legislators make progress on legalizing sports betting</h1><p>Florida legislators are making progress on legalizing sports betting in the state, with both chambers of the legislature considering bills that would allow it.</p>
<p>If the bills pass, Florida would join a growing number of states that have legalized sports betting in one form or another. Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia all have some form of legalized sports betting, and more states are likely to follow suit in the future.</p>
<p>There is still some debate as to how exactly sports betting would be legalized in Florida. The Senate bill would allow statewide wagering, while the House bill would allow only gambling at casinos and horse tracks.</p>
<p>Proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it would bring in new revenue for the state government,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> as well as create new jobs. They also say that it would help to regulate an industry that is currently operating in a legal gray area.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. They also contend that it would not be worth the revenue that it would generate.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen which version of the bill will prevail, but lawmakers seem intent on passing a bill this year.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-could-be-legalized-in-Florida-by-summer"><a href="#Sports-betting-could-be-legalized-in-Florida-by-summer" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting could be legalized in Florida by summer"></a>Sports betting could be legalized in Florida by summer</h1><p>The Florida legislature will consider a bill to legalize sports betting this year, with the goal of having it in place by the start of the summer sports season.</p>
<p>“It is something that we are looking at and it is something that we anticipate being in front of the Florida Legislature this upcoming session,” said Ryan Doughty, a spokesperson for the Florida House Speaker.</p>
<p>Doughty didn’t give a specifics on the proposed bill, but he said that it would involve regulation and taxation of sports betting. Sports leagues like the NFL and MLB have been lobbying for legalization in order to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has also been pushing for legalization in Florida, as well as other states. Adelson has been a major donor to Republican candidates and causes, and he believes that gambling can be a major revenue generator for state governments.</p>
<p>Adelson has started his own lobbying group, the Coalition to Stop Sports Betting Now, to push for nationwide legalization. The group includes conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and anti-gambling activists like by former senator Blanche Lincoln.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to more addiction and crime. They also say that it will damage the integrity of sporting events. Supporters argue that legal gambling will be tightly regulated and will generate much-needed revenue for state governments.</p>
<p>In 2017, $150 billion was wagered on sporting events worldwide, but only about 3 percent of that was bet legally. The vast majority of bets were placed illegally in India, China, and other countries where online gambling is not regulated.</p>
<p>If legalized in Florida, sports betting would likely take place at casinos and racetracks around the state. There would be wagering on professional and collegiate sports, as well as other events like golf or horse racing.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-close-to-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Florida-close-to-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Florida close to legalizing sports betting"></a>Florida close to legalizing sports betting</h1><p>On Monday, lawmakers in the Florida state senate began discussing a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. If the bill is passed, it would allow casinos and racetracks to offer bets on professional and college sports.</p>
<p>The move towards legalization comes after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting last year. Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize the activity, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Florida is currently one of only six states without any form of legalized gambling. Lawmakers say that legalizing sports betting would be a way to bring in additional revenue for the state.</p>
<p>“It’s something we need to do because it’s a major revenue producer,” said Senator Travis Hutson, who sponsored the bill. “It’s already happening. People are doing it illegally.”</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill predictably came from religious groups and anti-gambling advocates. Reverend Ron Pafford called the proposal “a terrible idea” and said that it would lead to more addiction and crime.</p>
<p>If the bill is passed, Florida would join a growing number of states that are taking advantage of the relaxed laws around sports betting. With billions of dollars wagered on sporting events every year, there is clearly potential for states to make significant profits from legalized gambling.</p>
