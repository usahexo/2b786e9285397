<p>The competition, which started with over 100 participants, was a huge success, with the final being watched by a live audience of more than 500 people.</p>
<p>The winner of the competition was 14-year-old Aryan Kulkarni, who correctly spelled the word ‘bingo’ to win the top prize of $2000.</p>
<p>Runner-up Priya Prakash, also 14 years old, won $1000 for her efforts.</p>

<p>The competition saw a field of 130 spellers, all aged below 12 years old, competing for the top spot. In the end, it was 10-year-old Ong Yu Xuan from Catholic High School who emerged as the champion, spelling the words ‘kerfuffle’ and ‘defenestration’ correctly to clinch first place.</p>

<p>Commenting on her win, Yu Xuan said, “I am very happy and excited that I have won the National Bingo Spelling Bee. This is my first time competing in an English spelling bee contest and I have learnt a lot of new words.”</p>
<p>The competition was stiff, with spellers from various schools across Singapore vying for the top spots. The final round saw spellers tackle difficult words such as ‘platonic’, ‘punditry’ and ‘Paramaribo’.</p>
<p>In a heartwarming show of support, parents and friends of the contestants turned up in large numbers to cheer on the young spellers. Many were seen waving flags and cheering loudly when their favourite speller nailed a word correctly.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere was electric. The parents were so supportive and encouraging,” said contest organiser Meera Maheshwari. “It was really wonderful to see so much enthusiasm for education and for young children doing their best.”</p>
<p>The NBSB is organised annually by philanthropic organisation J Association (JCA) in partnership withSPRING Singaporean English language learning portal bingoenglish.com. It is aimed at nurturing healthy competition among young spellers while improving their English language proficiency.</p>
