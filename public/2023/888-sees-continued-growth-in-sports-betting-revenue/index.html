The company’s sports betting business saw a 49% increase in revenue to $158 million, with the number of active customers up by 34%.</p>
<p>This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of sports betting, both in the UK and around the world. In the UK, the market is expected to grow to £10.5 billion by 2020, while globally the market is forecast to grow to $81.7 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>888 is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, with a strong product offering and a scalable platform that can handle rapid customer growth. The company has also been investing in its marketing efforts, with a focus on attracting new customers and building brand awareness.</p>
<p>888 CEO Brian Mattingley said: “The Group has delivered another good set of results with sports betting continuing to be a standout performer. We have made good progress against our strategic objectives during the period and I am pleased with our continued momentum in new customer acquisitions across all verticals”.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-create-a-winning-sports-betting-system"><a href="#How-to-create-a-winning-sports-betting-system" class="headerlink" title="How to create a winning sports betting system"></a>How to create a winning sports betting system</h1><p>Most people who gamble on sports do so with the hope of winning money. While there is no foolproof system for winning at sports betting, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of coming out ahead. In this article, we will discuss some of the basics of sports betting and offer a few tips for improving your overall odds.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to understand the basics of sports betting. In most cases, you will be betting on the outcome of a sporting event. You can either bet on the team that you think will win, or you can bet on the team that you think will lose. There are also other options available, such as betting on the point spread or betting on Over&#x2F;Under outcomes.</p>
<p>Once you understand the basics, you need to start by evaluating your own risk tolerance. How much money are you willing to lose if things don’t go your way? This is an important question to ask yourself because it will help dictate how much money you should place on any given bet. If you are not comfortable with losing a certain amount of money, then it is probably best not to wager any more than that amount.</p>
<p>The next step is to find a reputable online sportsbook. Not all online sportsbooks are created equal and some are much better than others. Do your research and make sure to read reviews from other customers before signing up with any particular site. Once you have found a good sportsbook, be sure to create an account and fund it with enough money so that you can make multiple bets.</p>
<p>Now that you have everything in order, it’s time to start placing bets! Begin by looking at the matchups for upcoming games and choosing which ones you think will be most competitive. Try to isolate games where both teams have a good chance of winning, as this will give you the best odds for making a profit. Once you have picked your game, take a look at the odds and decide how much money you want to risk on it. Be sure to always bet within your comfort zone and never bet more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>If all goes well, eventually you will start winning some bets and making some profits! Just remember to stay disciplined and only bet what you can afford to lose. With a bit of luck and some shrewd decision making, you can make Sports Betting work foryou and turn into a profitable venture!</p>
