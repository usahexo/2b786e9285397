This leaves the other players with a much better chance of taking home the grand prize.</p>
<p>Johannes is a well-known poker player, but this didn’t seem to help him during the final table. He started out strong, but quickly lost all of his chips after making some bad decisions. This left him in 8th place, and out of the running for the grand prize.</p>
<p>The other players are now vying for the top spot, with only 7 remaining. The competition is sure to be fierce, as everyone is fighting for the chance to take home the $100,000 prize.</p>
<h1 id="Johannes-Falls-Victim-to-a-Tough-Pot-Out-in-Seventh-Place"><a href="#Johannes-Falls-Victim-to-a-Tough-Pot-Out-in-Seventh-Place" class="headerlink" title="Johannes Falls Victim to a Tough Pot; Out in Seventh Place"></a>Johannes Falls Victim to a Tough Pot; Out in Seventh Place</h1><p>It was an unfortunate end for Johannes Voorn at the EPT 12 Grand Final in Monaco on Wednesday. The 26-year-old Dutchman, who began the day as one of the chip leaders, was eliminated from the tournament in seventh place when his couldn’t improve against Dimitar Danchev’s on a board of .</p>
<p>The elimination meant that Voorn picked up €216,000 for his efforts, but he’ll no doubt be disappointed to have missed out on a chance to become only the second player ever to win two EPT titles.</p>
<p>Danchev will now join Pierre Neuville and Dominik Panka as one of three players still in contention for the title, with the Bulgarian holding a slim lead over his two rivals heading into Thursday’s final table.</p>
<p>Here is a look at how Day 5 of the EPT 12 Grand Final played out: </p>
<p>Johannes Voorn started Day 5 of the EPT 12 Grand Final as one of the chip leaders, but he was ultimately unable to hold onto his advantage and was eliminated from the tournament in seventh place. </p>
<p>Voorn lost most of his chips in a huge hand against Dimitar Danchev. With just 10 big blinds remaining, Voorn moved all-in with and Danchev called with . The flop increased Danchev’s lead, coming as it did alongside two hearts. The turn was irrelevant, but the river gave Voorn a little hope when it produced another heart. However, that hope turned to despair when Danchev showed him down for a set of queens. </p>
<p>That hand effectively ended Voorn’s tournament, and he was eventually eliminated from play when his failed to improve against Danchev’s on a board of . Voorn took home €216,000 for his efforts. </p>
<p>With Voorn’s departure, Dimitar Danchev assumed sole possession of the chip lead with 3.7 million chips. He is followed by Pierre Neuville (3 million) and Dominik Panka (2.9 million). </p>
<h1 id="Johannes-Eliminated-from-Poker-Tournament-in-Sixth-Place"><a href="#Johannes-Eliminated-from-Poker-Tournament-in-Sixth-Place" class="headerlink" title="Johannes Eliminated from Poker Tournament in Sixth Place"></a>Johannes Eliminated from Poker Tournament in Sixth Place</h1><p>Heading out in sixth place from the €550 “Single Day High Roller” at the ongoing Spielbank Berlin stop on the European Poker Tour (EPT) is German ace Johannes Strassmann.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old pro, who has more than $1.5 million in career cashes, got the last of his chips in with K♦Q♥ against Niels Lade Vestbjerg’s A♣9♦ and failed to connect with the board reading 4♥8♠3♣7♦2♣. </p>
<p>This elimination leaves Ludovic Geilich as the chip leader with 1,180,000 in chips. He is closely followed by Manig Loeser (1,090,000) and Ramin Hajiyev (1,030,000). </p>
<p>In addition to the trophy and bragging rights, the eventual winner will also take home €115,000. </p>
<p>Here is a look at the complete chip counts heading into the final table: </p>
<ol>
<li>Ludovic Geilich – 1,180,000 </li>
<li>Manig Loeser – 1,090,000 </li>
<li>Ramin Hajiyev – 1,030,000 </li>
<li>Fabian Quoss – 960,000 </li>
<li>Dario Sammartino – 920,000 </li>
<li>Johannes Strassmann – 810,000 </li>
<li>Kevin MacPhee – 740,000 </li>
<li>Mustapha Kanit – 720,000</li>

<h1 id="Johannes-Drops-out-of-Poker-Tournament-in-Fifth-Place"><a href="#Johannes-Drops-out-of-Poker-Tournament-in-Fifth-Place" class="headerlink" title="Johannes Drops out of Poker Tournament in Fifth Place"></a>Johannes Drops out of Poker Tournament in Fifth Place</h1><p>Johannes dropped out of the poker tournament in fifth place, earning himself a tidy $75,000 payout. The German-born player had been one of the favourites to take the top prize, but his early elimination leaves the competition wide open.</p>
<p>“It’s always disappointing to come so close and not win,” Johannes said after leaving the table. “But I’m still happy with my performance. Fifth place is nothing to be ashamed of.”</p>
<p>Johannes started the final table as one of the shortest stacks, but he managed to claw his way back into contention. However, his luck finally ran out when he called all-in with Q-J against A-10. The ace turned up on the flop, ending Johannes’ tournament run.</p>
<h1 id="Johannes-Fights-Hard-but-Falls-Short-Eliminated-in-Fourth-Place"><a href="#Johannes-Fights-Hard-but-Falls-Short-Eliminated-in-Fourth-Place" class="headerlink" title="Johannes Fights Hard but Falls Short; Eliminated in Fourth Place"></a>Johannes Fights Hard but Falls Short; Eliminated in Fourth Place</h1><p>Johannes Gutenberg, the founder of the printing press and movable type, would have been proud of his namesake Saturday night. Johannes, a 24-year old poker pro from Germany, put on a valiant fight but was ultimately eliminated in fourth place in the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold’em Main Event at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In what can only be described as a heart-wrenching rollercoaster ride of a final table, Johannes started off strong by winning several key hands in the early stages to take a commanding chip lead. However, things began to unravel for him as the other players mounted a comeback.</p>
<p>A key hand occurred when Johannes 3-bet jammed all in with A♣7♥ on a board of 4♠T♦8♥9♦ and was called by eventual runner-up Tony Miles with Q♦J♠. The river was the J♥ and Johannes was out of contention.</p>
<p>Despite his fourth-place finish, Johannes walked away with $1.5 million – a career high prize money win – and can hold his head up high knowing that he gave it his all against some of the best players in the world.</p>
