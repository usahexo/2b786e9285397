are the benefits of getting eyelashes grafted","date":"2022-08-29T15:21:13.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the benefits of getting eyelashes grafted?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to getting eyelashes grafted. One of the most obvious is that it can significantly improve your appearance. Grafted eyelashes will look fuller and thicker, making you look more youthful and attractive. Additionally, grafted eyelashes are also more resistant to damage and infection than natural eyelashes, meaning they will last longer and require less maintenance.\n\n#  How much does it cost to get eyelashes grafted?\n\nLash grafting, a surgical procedure to improve the appearance of eyelashes, can cost several hundred to over a thousand dollars.\n\nThe price of lash grafting ranges depending on the doctor, the location, and what is included in the surgery. Generally, lash grafting prices start at around $300 and can go up to $1,200 or more.\n\nSome doctors include anesthesia and recovery fees in the overall cost of the surgery while others charge an additional fee for those services. Some doctors also offer package deals which can lower the overall price per procedure.\n\nIt is important to speak with your doctor about the cost of lash grafting as well as what is included in the surgery so that there are no surprises after you have had the procedure done.\n\n#  What are the risks associated with getting eyelashes grafted?\n\nThere are a few risks associated with getting eyelashes grafted. The most common is that the eyelashes may not take to the graft and will fall out. There is also a risk of infection, as with any surgical procedure. Finally, there is a very small risk of blindness if the graft does not take correctly.\n\n#  How long does the procedure take?\n\nDifferent surgical procedures take different lengths of time. For instance, a simple procedure such as removal of a lipoma, which is a noncancerous tumor, might only take a half an hour. However, more complicated procedures, such as heart surgery, can take several hours.\n\n# What are the risks associated with the surgery?\n\nAll surgeries come with some level of risk. Some risks are common to all surgeries, such as infection. Other risks may be specific to the surgery being performed. For example, heart surgery carries a risk of stroke or heart attack. It is important for patients to understand the risks associated with their surgery and to talk with their doctor about any concerns they may have.\n\n# What is the recovery time after surgery?\n\nRecovery time after surgery varies depending on the individual and the type of surgery performed. Most surgeries require some level of recovery time in the hospital post-surgery. After leaving the hospital, patients will likely need to take it easy for a while as their body recovers. Full recovery can take several weeks or months.\n\n#  Are there any side effects associated with getting eyelashes grafted?\n\nThere are no documented side effects associated with getting eyelashes grafted. However, as with any surgical procedure, there is always a small risk of infection or other complication. It is important to consult with a qualified surgeon to discuss the risks and benefits of eyelash grafting before making a decision.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-benefits-of-getting-eyelashes-grafted.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the benefits of getting eyelashes grafted\ndate: 2022-08-29 23:21:13\ncategories:\n- Makeup\ntags:\n- Eyelash Makeup\n- Eyelash Grafting\n- False Eyelashes\n- False Eyelashes\n- Eyelash Curler\n---\n\n\n#  What are the benefits of getting eyelashes grafted?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to getting eyelashes grafted.
